Java’s Selection statements:--- 
    if
    if-else
    nested-if
    if-else-if
    switch-case
    jump --Java supports three jump statements: break, continue and return
        --  break:- Terminate a sequence in a switch statement. To exit a loop. Used as a “civilized” form of goto., 
            continue:-you might want to continue running the loop but stop processing the remainder of the code in its body for this particular iteration, 
            return:- explicitly return from a method. That is, it causes program control to transfer back to the caller of the method.

SWITCH:--
switch (expression)
{
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
  .
  .
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
  default:
    statementDefault;
}

Loops in Java

for loop: for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. 
          Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping. 
Syntax:

for (initialization condition; testing condition;increment/decrement)
{
    statement(s)
}
----------------------------------------------------------------
while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. 
            The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

While loop starts with the checking of Boolean condition. If it evaluated to true, then the loop body statements are executed otherwise first statement following the loop is executed. 
For this reason it is also called Entry control loop.
Syntax :
while (boolean condition)
{
   loop statements...
}
----------------------------------------------------------------
do while:  Do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for 
           condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop. 
           (i)do while loop starts with the execution of the statement(s). There is no checking of any condition for the first time.
           (ii)do-while loop will execute its statements atleast once before any condition is checked, and therefore is an example of exit control loop.
Syntax:

do
{
    statements..
}
while (condition);
